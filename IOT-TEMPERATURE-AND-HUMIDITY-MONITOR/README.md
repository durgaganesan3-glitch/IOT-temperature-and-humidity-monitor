# IOT-TEMPERATURE-AND-HUMIDITY-MONITOR
Environmental monitoring plays a crucial role in modern life as it directly  influences human comfort, industrial efficiency, agricultural productivity, and  healthcare standards. Among the various environmental parameters, temperature  and humidity are two of the most significant. Temperature affects not only the  comfort level of living beings but also has a strong influence on chemical  processes, storage conditions, and the functioning of electronic devices.  Humidity, on the other hand, plays a vital role in determining the level of moisture  in the air, which impacts human health, agricultural yields, and material  preservation. A continuous and accurate measurement of these parameters is  therefore essential in multiple domains ranging from homes to industries and  scientific research.
